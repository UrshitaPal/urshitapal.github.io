  <h2>Research interests</h2>

  <p>I am interested in studying (co)homology of arithemetic groups like SL_nZ, and (co)homological stability patterns in families of groups and topological spaces. Surprisingly, a lot of these questions often boil down to proving high-connectivity of suitably defined simplicial complexes, which can then be done using combinatorial descriptions of these complexes. Overall I tend to enjoy any math that involves topology, algebra and combinatorics (and pretty pictures!)</p>

    					  This talk aims to give an exposition of recent work of Ash-Miller-Patzt, establishing a Hopf algebra structure on the cohomology groups H^k(GLnZ; Q). These groups are of interest in several areas of mathematics but have proven difficult to compute. I will discuss how they can be studied via "Steinberg modules", describe how this can be used to put a Hopf algebra structure on them, and how this helps to find new cohomology classes.

      		  		  <div id="TalbotArcs-talk" style='display:none;'>
						  We discuss the full arc complex and the complex of disordered arcs on an oriented surface. We will use Hatcher's flow argument to show that the full arc complex is contractible, and from this deduce high connectivity of the disordered arc complex using a "badness argument" with simplicial complexes that is standard in the literature. This high connectivity can be used to deduce homological stability of surface mapping class groups.

  		  <div id="ComboMorse-talk" style='display:none;'>
			  Discrete Morse Theory is a tool to study the homotopy type of a simplicial complex, via "nice" functions on it. It gives an algorithm for collapsing certain simplices without changing the homotopy type, thus simplifying the cell structure of the simplicial complex. This talk aims to give an overview of this technique, covering several examples along the way.

    		  		  <div id="DGTHopf-talk" style='display:none;'>
    					  This talk aims to give a gentle exposition of recent work establishing an algebraic structure on the groups H^k(GL_nZ; Q). These cohomology groups are of interest in several areas of mathematics, and computing them has proven extremely difficult. One approach to studying these groups is via "Steinberg modules", which are defined in terms of certain simplicial complexes. After giving a brief introduction to these objects, I will describe a combinatorial way to put a product and coproduct structure on the Steinberg modules, and discuss recent work of Ash-Miller-Patzt that used this to deduce a Hopf algebra structure on the cohomology H^k(GL_nZ; Q), and describe how this helps in finding new cohomology classes.

  		  		  <div id="ComboConf-talk" style='display:none;'>
  					  Configuration Spaces give good prototypical examples to understand the (co)homology of certain groups like braid groups, and the phenomenon of homological stability. In this talk we will explore the topology of configurations of n points on the plane. Through pictures and examples, we will first see how the motion of the particles generates (co)homology classes of these spaces. We will then see how to associate trees and graphs to these classes, and describe a combinatorial pairing between trees and graphs that is analogous to the pairing between cohomology and homology.

  					  The Nerve Lemma is a useful tool that, under some hypotheses, lets one compute the homology of a space in terms of a simplicial complex built from an open cover of the space. In this talk we shall see the statement of this lemma, a proof glimpse by analyzing a certain double complex, and if time permits, a proof sketch via (a gentle introduction to) spectral sequences.

  		  		  <div id="OttersDuality-talk" style='display:none;'>
  					  Certain classes of groups, such as the special linear groups over integers, satisfy a (co)homological duality property that allows one to study their rational cohomology groups. I'll discuss a criterion to test when a group satisfies this duality, and see how in the case of SLnZ this comes down to the fact that the Solomon-Tits building is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres.

  					  In this talk we will explore the topology of configurations of n points in Euclidean space. Through pictures and examples, we will first see how the motion of the particles generates (co)homology classes of these spaces. We will then see how to associate trees and graphs to these classes, and describe a combinatorial pairing between trees and graphs that is analogous to the pairing between cohomology and homology.

	  					  (Co)homology groups are important algebraic invariants associated to a group G. In this talk we will look at how to define group (co)homology algebraically and topologically, prove the equivalence of the two definitions, and briefly see examples where having both perspectives can help study various finiteness properties and duality properties of a group.

					  This the second of a 2 part series on the cohomology of the discrete group SLnZ - In the second talk, we’ll see the virtual cohomological dimension of SLnZ, and a duality result analogous to Poincaré duality, namely Borel-Serre duality, that helps compute higher dimensional cohomologies of SLnZ.

					  This is the first of a 2 part series on the cohomology of the discrete group SLnZ and topological tools used to study it - In this first talk, we'll define the notions of (co)homology of a group and cohomological dimension, and explore these notions in the specific case of SLnZ.

		  		  <div id="gc-talk" style='display:none;'>
					  Surprisingly, the cohomology ring of a complex grassmannian is isomorphic to a quotient of the ring of symmetric polynomials. While a great result in its own right, understanding this cohomology ring can also help solve problems in enumerative geometry.
					  <br> 
					  In this talk I will outline a proof of this result, and time permitting, we will also see an application of this in enumerative geometry.

  		  <div id="rs-talk" style='display:none;'>
			 Representation Stability is a phenomenon observed in many families of spaces - such as the pure braid groups, flag varieties, etc. - where the (co)homologies of a growing family of spaces stabilize as representations of the symmetric groups.
			  <br>
In this talk I will explain this phenomenon by focussing on (pure) braid groups as an example, with an emphasis on lots of pictures and minimal prerequisites.

		  <div id="ns-talk" style='display:none;'>
		     The Combinatorial Nullstellensatz is a statement about zeroes of a multi-variable polynomial over a field. It has seen a remarkable number of applications to number theory, enumerative combinatorics, and graph theory. Roughly speaking, it gives quantitative information on how a polynomial of a certain degree cannot vanish over a large enough set of values.
			<br>
In this talk I will briefly explain the statement of this theorem, and then illustrate through examples a general technique for using it to prove a variety of powerful results.

	  		    Braid groups are an interesting class of finitely generated groups that come up naturally in a wide range of areas in Mathematics - topology, dynamics, representation theory, cryptography, to name a few.<br>
Part of their importance is based on the many ways in which they can be defined. We will look at a few different interpretations of braid groups, and discuss some interesting structures on them as well as their applications.

			 The problem was about constructing a subspace of the "ordered square" (i.e., the square [0,1]^2 equipped with the the lexicographical/dictionary order topology) that was path-connected. The proof of path connectivity mimicked the proof idea of Urysohn's Lemma. Both Urysohn's Lemma and the ordered square had been recently introduced in the class at the time, so I wanted to write a problem whose solution combined both these concepts.
